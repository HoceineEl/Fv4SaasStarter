### General
- No obvious comments; only when non-trivial rationale

### PHP
- Prefer `match` over `switch`
- Use constructor property promotion; no empty constructors
- Inject services per usage: method injection (single method), constructor (multiple)
- Add return types; import classes via `use`

### Laravel
- Pivot tables named alphabetically (e.g., `project_role`)
- Observers via attribute: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]`
- Put validation in Form Requests
- Slim controllers; business logic in Services
- Prefer helpers: `auth()->id()`, `redirect()->route()`
- Policies auto-discovered
- Factories use `fake()`
- Blade uses Tailwind by default
